/// CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate
///
/// The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the rate of return that would be required for an investment
/// to grow from its beginning balance to its ending balance, assuming the profits were reinvested at the
/// end of each period of the investmentâ€™s life span.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `beginning_balance` - The initial investment or balance
/// * `ending_balance` - The final investment or balance
/// * `n` - The number of years
///
/// # Returns
/// * The compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
///
/// # Example
/// * Beginning balance of $1000, ending balance of $2000 after 5 years
/// ```
